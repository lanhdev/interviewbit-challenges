# Matrix Search

## Problem:
[https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/matrix-search](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/matrix-search)

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an `m x n` matrix.

This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The `first integer` of each row is greater than or equal to the `last integer` of the previous row.

Example:

**Input**
```
Matrix = [
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]

Target = 3
```

**Output**
```
1 corresponds to true
```

Return `0 / 1` (`0` if the element is not present, `1` if the element is present) for this problem

## Approach:

**1. Binary search on each row**

Traverse through the matrix and do binary search on each row to find expected target.

If found, return 1

If there is no target, return 0

Time complexity: `O(M * logN)`

**2. Binary search on matrix**

Treat matrix as sorted array

`n * m` matrix convert to an array => `matrix[x][y] => a[x * m + y]`

an array convert to `n * m` matrix => `a[x] => matrix[x / m][x % m];`

Why we are doing divmod on the middle element?

Suppose we have a `4 * 5` matrix. So we will have `4 * 5 = 20` elements in the matrix.

Now as the elements in each row are sorted and first element of each row is `>=` last element of previous row, we can think the 2D array as a linear sorted array and perform binary search on the array. But linear indexes won't work for our 2D array. Hereâ€™s where the division and modulo comes into play.

For an array of the above mentioned size, `left = 0` and `right = 19` in the beginning.

So in the first iteration `mid = (0 + 19) / 2 = 9`

Now we can not directly search `A[9]` because it is a 2D array.

So how to convert ?

- For row number divide mid by number of columns in the matrix (in this case 5) `9 / 5 = 1`

- For column number take mod of div by number of columns in matrix `9 % 5 = 4`

Thus from `9` we get `A[1][4]` which will be the required element to be compared for the binary search.

Time complexity: `O(logMN) = O(log(M) + log(N))`
